### Q: Why should I write a retrospective? What's in it for me?

A: Here are a few reasons you might want to write a retrospective: 
1. You get to make an impact in the machine learning community by increasing openness, and contributing towards establishing new norms. This experiment only works if people like you contribute!   
2.  You can get a workshop publication out of it (through our NeurIPS 2019 workshop);
3.  Similarly to how releasing code signals you care about reproducibility, writing a retrospective signals that you are open about your research (employers usually care about this);
4.  To reduce the number of emails you get about the same issues regarding your paper.
