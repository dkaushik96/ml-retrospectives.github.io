In science, the main way we communicate cutting-edge results is by writing papers. Papers are good because they give a blueprint for how the researchers got their results; papers usually motivate the main idea, describe how the researchers set up their experiments, and compare to existing approaches in the field. 

*But papers don’t always tell the full story.* Sometimes, they leave out important details because the authors wanted to publish by a certain deadline, or because it makes their proposed method look worse, or simply because they forgot. Other times, there are bugs in the code or errors in a proof that are not spotted until later. Researchers occasionally even develop a completely different motivation or intuition for their work than what is written in their paper. In all of these cases, there is a *divergence* between what the authors of the paper believe about their work, and what is actually written in the paper. This divergence is usually bad; for example, it can lead to misunderstandings of a paper’s claims, or wasted time as researchers attempt to build off of shaky results. 

*ML Retrospectives* is a new venue meant to address this divergence, by hosting the publication of *retrospectives*. A retrospective is a blog post-style article written by an author of a previous paper. The goal of a retrospective is to answer the question: *“What should readers of this paper know now, that isn’t in the original paper?”* **The principle behind retrospectives is to be as honest about your own work as possible** --- it’s okay to make mistakes, and we should encourage and incentivize researchers to talk about their work openly. 

We built *ML Retrospectives* using GitHub. Retrospectives are located in a public GitHub repository, and are submitted by making a pull request to that repository (see: [how it works](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/how/)). Retrospectives submitted before October 1, 2019 can also be considered as submissions to the [Retrospectives Workshop at NeurIPS 2019](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/retrospectives/neurips2019/). 

Some researchers already update their published work periodically, either through blog posts, conversations at conferences, or by uploading new versions of the paper to arXiv. We view retrospectives as complementary to these approaches, with specific benefits: retrospectives are informal (more like blog posts than papers), publicly accessible (don’t require conference attendance), and centrally located (all retrospectives are in one place). 

***The ultimate goal of retrospectives is to do better science, increase the openness and accessibility of the machine learning field, and to show that it’s okay to make mistakes.***

Have a previous paper where, looking back, you think: *“Huh, there’s a lot more I could say about this now”*? Consider writing a retrospective! [Here’s how to do it](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/retrospectives/how/).
